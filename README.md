Medical diagnostic app challenge for Light-It

This is my take on the Light-It challenge 'Medical Diagnostic' app.

Even though I'm happy with what I made in this 2 days, I feel like I could really do better if I had more time. I also think I wasted time in a couple of small things, and that could have been valuable time to spend in more important tasks, such as cleaning and refactoring code, improving the performance, and applying some better practices. 

 I did my best with the time I had, and I hope it fulfills your expectations. :)
